# NewsApp:
A simple news app made using flutter, which uses a RESTful API to fetch news articles from the internet using NEWSApi.org

# Goals and Future plans:
The goal of making this simple news app was to know and learn about RESTful Api's and how they are integrated and used with flutter. Primary goal was to learn functionality and not focus on UI. I will update the UI in the future.
